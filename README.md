# Bayes_project : Oxford Case : Smooth fit to log-odds ratios

## Project overview :

The aim of this project is to analyze the potential link between exposure to X-rays and childhood cancer rates. The project involves the use of statistical modeling techniques to estimate the odds ratio of exposure to X-rays in children with cancer compared to controls.
## Usage :
The project contains the following files:

oxford.data.R: An R file containing the values of the data.
Project__Bayes__Oxford.pdf: A report of the project.
Oxford_bayes_project.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the results of the analysis.

The results.ipynb file contains the results of the analysis in a Jupyter Notebook format, making it easy to view and interact with the results.


## Credits :
This project was created by Oussama Hadder ,Marwane Fahim, Salimou Moussa and Achraf Drissi with guidance from our professor Mathieu Ribatet.
